## Remote Control

This is a light weight remote control function that allows only mouse click events between peers. And as of such only the host can enable remote control.

Chat window features a simple but attractive chat gui where the users can share their thoughts

## File share

The File share option allows user to upload and download files to and from the peer. The transfer rate is pretty good i guess.

## Audio Call

Although not tested ( cause my mic is broken ) this allows the users to directly call each other. The voice gets slightly broken.

## Video Call

Same problem here! My webcam is also broken. Will update this feature asap!

## Whiteboard

The whiteboard feature allows both the user to share a board and with some handy features the experience would be excellent
